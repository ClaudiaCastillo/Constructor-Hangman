# Constructor-Hangman
A hangman command-line game using constructor functions.

# Advanced JavaScript Project: Constructor Hangman

In this project, create a hangman command-line game using constructor functions.

1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.
2. Keep track of the user's remaining guesses and prompt the user if they would like to end the game if none remain.
3. Each constructor function should be in it's own file and be exported and required wherever needed.
